Summary: in this tutorial, we will show you step by step how to reset forgotten password of postgres user in PostgreSQL.

For some reasons, after installing PostgreSQL, you may forget the password for the postgres user. In this case, you need to know how to reset the password.

PostgreSQL uses the  pg_hba.conf configuration file that is stored in the database data directory to control the client authentication. HBA means host-based authentication. To reset the password for the postgres user, you need to modify some parameters in this configuration file.

Step 1. Backup the pg_dba.conf file by copying it to a different location or just rename it to pg_dba_bk.conf

Step 2. Edit the pg_dba.conf file by adding the following line as the first line after the comment lines. The comment line starts with the # sign.
local  all   all   trust

If your PostgreSQL installation does not support local, which indicates UNIX sockets, for example, if you install PostgreSQL on Windows OS. If you use local in this case, you cannot start PostgreSQL service. In this situation, you need to use the following entry in the pg_hba.conf file:
host    all              postgres   	     127.0.0.1/32            trust

This step ensures that you can log into PostgreSQL database server without using the password.

Step 3. Restart PostgreSQL server e.g., in Linux, you use the following command:

sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Step 4. Connect to PostgreSQL database server and change the password of the postgres user.

ALTER USER postgres with password 'very_secure_password';

Step 5. Restore the pg_db.conf file and restart the server, and connect to the PostgreSQL database server with new password.

sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

In this tutorial, we have shown you how to reset the forgotten password of the postgres user.
